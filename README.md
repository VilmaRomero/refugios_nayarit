# Refugios Nayarit
Shiny App that lets Nayarit (or otherwise Mexican) users find the closest n shelters to their location.

Requires:
* A raw xslx as given by the DataLab, called "refugios_nayarit.xslx" to clean, OR
* A clean file called "refugios_nayarit_limpio.csv" 

Cleaning Script `clean_data.R` requires `path_to_file` in which the raw file called `refugios_nayarit.xlsx` can be found. The name of the file can be changed too, in order to be able to replicate this for other states.

**This is what the tool looks like:**
